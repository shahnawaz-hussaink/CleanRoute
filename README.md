**Problem Statement**

Delhi faces severe and rapidly changing air pollution levels that put millions of people at daily health risk. Existing AQI platforms show general pollution data but do not help users understand which specific routes are safer, when it is safe to step outside, or how pollution varies across areas in real time. As a result, users unknowingly travel through highly polluted zones without any personalized guidance.
CleanRoute solves this by providing real-time AQI heatmaps, pollution-safe route suggestions, and custom alerts, enabling smarter and healthier mobility decisions.
